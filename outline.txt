=== Requirements ===

-- Goal: Demonstrate a CPU scheduler that outputs (Waiting + Turnaround + Response).
- Use any method from the following (FCFS - SJF - Priority - Round Robin).
- Language use : (Java | Team).
- Document your code thoroughly, including clear explanations of functions, classes, and modules.
- Consider including examples or sample inputs/outputs to illustrate how your code should be used.

- Apply OOP Concepts (exclude abstraction) (Inheritince is optional)
- Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
- Use Comments only if necessary (Don't comment everything)

=== Design ===

- class Process {ProcessID- Burst - arrival}
-- Handle each process alone
-- Process should not generate arrival

- class Program
-- Handle All processes
-- Program is the generator of arrival
-- Program can reset Arrival if onther operation is done
-- can have multiple options -algorithms- to work (optional)

=== Implementaion ===

-- This is a group discuss --

Some point to be discussed: 
1- How a certain algorithm should be implemented.
2- What variable standared to allow communication between classes
3- What Data Structures are we going to use.
4- How to make the system dynamic.
