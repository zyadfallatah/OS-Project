=== Requirements ===

-- Goal: Demonstrate a CPU scheduler that outputs (Waiting + Turnaround + Response).
- Use any method from the following (FCFS - SJF - Priority - Round Robin).
- Language use : (Java | Team).
- Document your code thoroughly, including clear explanations of functions, classes, and modules.
- Consider including examples or sample inputs/outputs to illustrate how your code should be used.

=== Design ===
- class Process {ProcessID- Burst - arrival}
-- Handle each process alone
-- Process should not generate arrival

- class Program
-- Handle All processes
-- Program is the generator of arrival
-- Program can reset Arrival if onther operation is done
